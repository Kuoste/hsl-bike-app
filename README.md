# HSL City Bikes

A Blazor WebAssembly app showing real-time Helsinki city bike station availability, trend tracking, cycle lane overlay, and historical trip data.

**Live:** https://kuoste.github.io/hsl-bike-app/

## Features

- Real-time bike station availability from Digitransit GBFS API
- Interactive Leaflet.js map with color-coded station markers
- Availability trend tracking (instant on page load via pre-built snapshots)
- Change indicators showing bikes rented/returned between refreshes
- Station detail panel with popular trip destinations
- Helsinki cycle lane overlay from open WFS data
- Dark mode support (follows OS preference)
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds + manual refresh

## Architecture

- **Blazor WebAssembly** — standalone, hosted as static files on GitHub Pages
- **Leaflet.js** — raw JS interop for map rendering (OSM tiles)
- **Digitransit GBFS API** — real-time station data
- **GitHub Actions** — snapshot poller (every 5 min) for instant trend data on load
- **hsl-bike-data-aggregator** — historical trip data (separate repo)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. For local development, create `src/HslBikeApp/wwwroot/appsettings.Development.json` and set your Digitransit subscription key there:
   ```json
   { "DigitransitSubscriptionKey": "your-key-here" }
   ```
   `appsettings.Development.json` is gitignored and overrides values from `appsettings.json` when running locally with the `Development` environment.
3. Run locally:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/HslBikeApp
   ```
   In VS Code, the default debug profile now uses a plain run-once launch. Use the separate watch profile only when you want hot reload.
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Seasonal behavior

HSL city bikes are seasonal. Outside the operating season, the upstream live station feed can legitimately return zero active stations. When that happens, the app now shows an explicit status message instead of leaving the map blank without explanation.

## API Key

Get a free API key from the [Digitransit API portal](https://portal-api.digitransit.fi/).  
The key is used for rate-limiting — it's a public transit API, not a secret.

For GitHub Actions snapshot poller, add `DIGITRANSIT_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` as a repository secret.
